# Organiq Core Device Proxy

Organiq is a platform for developing applications that interact with the real world.

The Organiq Core Device Proxy contains library code that is shared by other Organiq components, including the JavaScript SDK (organiq/organiq-sdk-js) and the Organiq Gateway Server (organiq/organiq-gateway). It defines the device registration, underlying message passing and processing engine.

Typical application development with Organiq should not need reference this project directly, as it is already included as a dependency where necessary.
